### Portable computing

Or the thing I should have mentioned earlier on this blog...  
Our smartphones - these tiny things in our pockets are really powerful these days. On some of the Android devices you can even emulate Nintendo Switch games or run LLMs to communicate with AI offline.  
But the point is when and how it becomes a standard? Because there's so much potential in these things, we just can't throw it out for no reason, like we already did with smart glasses and smartwatches.

Let me show you this: https://youtu.be/vuSGXmsvp_Q  
The guy in the video made the prototype of his own controller for iPhones with MagSafe. That's pretty cool I guess ðŸ™‚  

I believe in portable computing. I want my phone to be able to run AAA games and not causing global warming in the same time. The whole market of portable game consoles is just made from thin air. There's no reason to not optimise and port your games to the phones.  

Except for the monopoly. Companies like Nintendo want us to pay them for their restrictive platform to play the games we want. That's not fair. Games should be available for everyone, because we can run them everywhere already. And in the future things will become even better.  
But it will happen only if we force these mobile companies like Apple and Google to make their platforms truly open. Don't get me wrong, I don't support government restrictions or any kind of regulation, except for maybe EU ones (caused by EU, not the European governments themselves).  
I believe in free market. So we need to take action to show our strong protest against the both Apple iOS restrictions and Google Android ones.  
This including:  
- not having the ability to make yourself root user ON YOUR OWN DEVICE
- having to pay and being inside EU to install alternative app stores (IOS)
- the full monopoly on payment system and up to 30% commission(!!) for each transaction
- not having full access to a file system

Your phone is not any kind different from your computer. Your need to gain the full control. On Android you can install alternative rom and gain root access, but that's not enough. It must be open by default.  
Only after that we will make our smartphones truly free. And this process has already started.
