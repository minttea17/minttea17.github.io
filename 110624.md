[WWDC 24](https://www.youtube.com/live/RXeOiIDNNek) - Some notes

Vision OS 2  
Super cool. That absolutely will be the future.

iPhone Mirroring  
What if I want to spy on somebody with my iPhone located in another room? Can I get an image from a camera or record sound?
I think that Apple thought through this and both video and audio will stream from the Mac, but that's very interesting to test.

Passwords App  
Just don't use it. Don't store your passwords on iCloud, even in encrypted form. That's just not secure.
Bitwarden, KeePass - use anything that is open source and heavily audited.

AI in Safari  
Don't use it. That's not private, because the user does not actively agree for Safari to browse the web related to the topic of the page.

Apple Intelligence  
It will be 100% incredible, but only if you can opt out of on-cloud processing by Apple and ensure that only the features that can run on the device are active.

That's great that Apple is in partnership with OpenAI to provide the GPT-4o functionality WITH ACTIVE USER PERMISSION. We need the same dialog when it wants to send data to the Apple's servers too.  
There's no "Private cloud computing", it's just a big lie by Apple. There's always will be a technical ability to spy on users. Nothing else required.

But I am happy to see local AI features for everyone these days. That's revolutionaly.
